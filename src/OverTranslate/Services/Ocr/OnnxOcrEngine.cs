/// The detector used to return boxes that start part way along a line, losing the characters before
/// them with nothing in the log to say they existed. It was the detector input's geometry, not the
/// model — see <see cref="CreateDetectorFrame"/> and the note above <c>DetectorAlignment</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// #69 closed this as unfixable and said not to look for the setting that causes it, which was
/// right in its own terms: it is not a setting, it is how the image was being resized. Everything
/// that round ruled out stays ruled out, and each was ruled out with a measurement — the
/// recognition confidence floor (the leading box is never returned, so nothing filters it), all
/// three detector box thresholds (<see cref="DetectorThresholdOverride"/> — dropping BoxScoreThresh
/// to 0.10, which discards nothing, changes not one character), the normalisation statistics
/// (<see cref="ShippedDetector"/>), the detector size (<c>--scale-sweep</c>), and how tightly the
/// user framed the capture (<c>--margin-series</c> over 27 whole screens: 1.1% apart).
///
/// The border (<see cref="DetectorPaddingOverride"/>, 0 to 96) was ruled out there too and should
/// not have been: it was swept while the distortion was still in place, where it is an input to the
/// aligned dimensions and so changes the squash along with itself. See
/// <c>DetectorPadding</c> for the re-sweep.
///
/// #69's own best evidence is what names the cause, read the other way round. It found the response
/// knife-edge ALONG THE SHORT AXIS ONLY: cropping one pixel off the top took the reading from 5
/// characters to 6 and four pixels took it to 10, while cropping eight off the side changed nothing;
/// appending blank rows below the picture, which touches no content at all, walked it between 5 and
/// 10 with no pattern. That is a 32-pixel quantisation step on the short axis being crossed and
/// re-crossed — a few pixels of height nobody chose deciding how far the image gets squashed. The
/// conclusion drawn at the time ("a frame either reads or does not, replacing the detector is the
/// only lever left", and #33's rejection of PP-OCRv6_det_medium at 90ms and 62MB) followed from
/// reading that as model behaviour.

    // size. A 264x56 capture reaches the detector squashed to 0.88x horizontally but 0.62x
    // vertically; widen the same selection by six pixels and 270x60 comes out 0.86x by 1.00x. That
    // is why two captures of identical pixels could recognise differently ("domain" -> "donain"):
    // the user's selection box, not the glyphs, was choosing the aspect ratio.
    //
    // Detect() pads the bitmap by options.Padding on all four sides and, for anything below
    // ImgResize, targets exactly that padded long side — so the scale factor is already 1.0 on the
    // long axis and the quantisation is the only thing left distorting the image. Growing the
    // bitmap so the padded dimensions land on multiples of DetectorAlignment skips the
    // quantisation on both axes, and the detector sees native, undistorted pixels.
    //
    // Only the right and bottom edges grow, leaving block coordinates in the caller's frame, and
    // the added pixels are the same transparent black Detect() already surrounds every capture
    // with — this pushes that border out by under 32px rather than introducing a new edge.
    //
    // WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX. Above ImgResize a real downscale takes over, and there this buys
    // nothing: Detect() scales the padded image so its long side lands on ImgResize exactly (a
    // multiple of 32, so that axis survives), then quantises the short axis anyway, costing it
    // another 0-63px. A 2330x1102 capture still reaches the detector squashed by 5.2%, a
    // 2554x1437 one by 2.9% — small next to the 30% above, but still an amount that moves with
    // the selection size. Captures that large therefore behave exactly as they did before this
    // change, residual squash included.
    //
    // THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE DESCRIBED A GUARANTEE THIS METHOD NEVER HAD, and it is why the leading
    // characters of a line kept going missing. Detect() targets
    // min(ImgResize, aligned long side) + 2 * Padding, and ImgResize is computed from the size
    // BEFORE alignment — Realtime.RealtimeDetectorSize is asked about the region the user framed.
    // Alignment then grows that bitmap by up to 31px, so the target lands just UNDER the padded
    // long side, the ratio is no longer 1.0, and the quantisation runs after all. On a 465x76
    // dialogue box the aligned 576x192 reached the detector as 512x128: 0.89x across, 0.67x down.
    // Under it, "「うん、" was never detected at all.
    //
    // So the downscale is done here instead, isotropically, and ImgResize is then set above the
    // input so the library's own resize is the identity — see CreateDetectorFrame. Both prepared
    // dimensions are multiples of DetectorAlignment by construction at that point, which is the
    // one case ScaleParam leaves alone. The detector finally sees the aspect ratio it was handed.
